Thanks for downloading and taking an interest in using and looking at my Tic Tac Toe Chat Roulette.

For Absolute Beginners on mac or linux systems:
1) Download node.js from nodejs.org and install it

2) After it is installed, open the terminal and type ‘cd’.

3) After typing in ‘cd’, drag and drop the ‘tic-tac-toe-sockets’ folder into the terminal window

4) Hit enter on the keyboard. (now you are in the folder.)

5) type in ‘npm install’ and hit enter. Please wait a few minutes for the modules to download and install.

6) now that the installation is complete, type ‘node server.js’.

7) The terminal will reply a message back to you indicating what the url is. Now copy the link, minimize terminal, and type the link into your web browser (ex. chrome, firefox, internet explorer, etc.). 

8) To shut down the tic tac toe application, open up the minimized terminal. Now hit control and c at the same time on your keyboard.
